		<h1 class="title">About</h1>
		<p>
		My name is Italo Amaya and I am currently pursuing a Bsc in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.
		I have just finished researching Deep Learning Techniques for Detecting Steganography!
		</p>
		<p>
		I am a highly <span class="text-orange-500">curious</span> individual! Don't take my word just ask my mom :) hi mom. Currently this curiosity has driven me to build my own Auto Differentiation Tensor Library in Rust [here](https://github.com/italoaa/Rusty-Flow) to talking GPU programming in CUDA [Mnist from Scratch](https://github.com/italoaa/Mnist-from-scratch). 
		</p>
		<p>
		I constantly find new ways of challenging myself, growing my knowledge and nourishing personal spirit. This sometimes drives me crazy ... sometimes
		</p>
