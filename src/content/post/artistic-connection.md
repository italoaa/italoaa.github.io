## Artistic Connection
Lately I have finished a book which I really loved. This made me think of all those times that I also loved other artistic expressions. These include photos, movies, series, music, etc. I feel like most of the time the connection one develops with a certain artistic piece is extreme personal. To a certain extend no one can understand how that piece made you feel but yourself. Sometimes painful when you show one of your favourite movies to someone and find they fell asleep. Sometimes revealing when you find someone that appreciates that piece as much as you do. Either way it goes to show how we are so different from one another
