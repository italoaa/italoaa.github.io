## Artistic Connection
Lately I have finished a book which I really loved. This made me think of all those times that I also loved other artistic expressions. By artistic expressions I mean photos, movies, series, music, etc. The connection one develops with a certain artistic piece is extremely personal, and to a certain extent the only person that really understands that artistic connect is yourself. For example, in the case of our favourite movies or songs we frequently discover that our enthusiasm for them isnâ€™t universally felt. This is because your connection to the art is tied to your current situation/context (I believe). By situation/context I mean to encompass everything from the state of mind to your physical position. These contexts form the idea of a stereotype, where a group of people that are closely related in their context or situation find that they enjoy similar things. If the context is what determines this connection then is this what makes us unique?
