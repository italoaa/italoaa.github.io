## What is thought?
I'm no neurologist, but I often wonder what intelligence or thought actually is. It seems to me that intelligence might be a higher-dimensional concept. A concept that we, as three-dimensional beings, can’t fully grasp.

I don’t mean “higher-dimensional” in the strict physical sense, like an extra axis. I’m using it in a metaphorical way to express the kind of perspective shift intelligence might require to be truly understood. Like how a 2D being couldn’t possibly imagine a sphere, maybe we’re limited in how we think about thought itself.
