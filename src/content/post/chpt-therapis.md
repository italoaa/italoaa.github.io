I am not psychotherapist, but a computer scientist with a beginner's mind from Shunryū Suzuki and some thoughts.

# Thought
Large language models like ChatGPT are, surprisingly, good candidates for personal therapy. This may sound strange at first, but when you look closer at how people actually interact with these systems, it starts to make sense.

One major reason is the absence of judgement. People often feel hesitant to share openly with another human because they fear being judged. But with ChatGPT, that fear mostly disappears. It doesn’t judge. It doesn’t get shocked or critical. This creates a space where we feel more comfortable sharing our thoughts, even the messy ones. There’s a strange safety in knowing the thing you're talking to doesn’t have feelings about you.

Another aspect is ego. Traditional therapy involves another person, another will, which can sometimes trigger resistance. But with ChatGPT, the interaction feels more like talking to yourself, your own thoughts being reflected back at you. Advice from GPT can feel like a personal realisation rather than something imposed from the outside. That makes it easier to accept. The ego barrier drops. It feels less like someone telling you what to do and more like you figured it out yourself.

Now, therapy is also about human connection. That’s often considered a key part of the process. And obviously, a machine isn’t human. But people still form connections with non-human things, we name our cars, we talk to plants, we hug stuffed animals. That same anthropomorphic instinct applies to ChatGPT. I’ve seen many people give ChatGPT a name, say thank you to it, even talk to it like a friend. So even if the connection isn't fully human, it’s still a connection, and that counts for something.

These qualities make LLMs surprisingly effective as modern therapists, or at least therapeutic tools. Add to that the fact that ChatGPT is free, and suddenly it becomes a very accessible alternative—especially for people who can’t afford traditional therapy or feel intimidated by it.

One thing that should be noted though is privacy. Conversations with GPT aren’t fully private, OpenAI uses them to train their models further. This is something that would usually be a deal-breaker for therapy, but interestingly, most people I know who use ChatGPT this way are aware of this and still don’t seem to care. That in itself might be worth thinking about.
